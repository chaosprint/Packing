# Packing

Packing is an interactive sound synthesis interface in SuperCollider.

## Motivation

When I studied MA Sonic Arts at the University of Sheffield, I used Trevor Wishart's CDP a lot.

`Neutral` is one of my favourite tools in CDP.

However, limited by the time it is developed, it only works in non-real-time, so I rewrote it SuperCollider.

To give real-time interactive capability to the instrument actually brings surprisingly new possibilities.

I have used it in the performance at the [Oslo World Music Festival 2019](https://youtu.be/dYu55YZJH_s?t=102).

Still, the non-real-time synthesis is there, and the experience is enhanced with the SuperCollier automation tool `EnvDraw` I wrote as a bonus in this repo.

## Usage

### Step 1
Download this repo, and unzip it.

### Step 2
Put the folders and files into the `Extension` folder of your SuperCollider.

### Step 3
Recompile SuperCollider classes.
Then you can run:
```
Packing()
```
You can read the docs inside SuperCollider.
